# 📌 Identity Governance & Risk Foundations Project
## Governance, Risk, and Compliance Deep Dive 🔐📚

---

## 🧠 Summary / What It Does  

This project documents my practical understanding of Governance, Risk, and Compliance principles through structured scenario based assessments and regulatory mapping.

It covers core frameworks and standards, including:

• PCI DSS  
• GDPR  
• HIPAA  
• NIST 800 53  
• Risk Management within GRC  

The objective was simple and intentional:  
Demonstrate applied knowledge of governance structures, risk prioritisation, compliance requirements, and control categorisation.

This project reflects structured thinking, regulatory awareness, and security maturity.

## ⚙️ Tools & Tech  

• Governance frameworks  
• Regulatory analysis  
• NIST 800 53 control families  
• Risk assessment methodology  
• Markdown documentation  
• GitHub project structuring  

Built as a hands-on validation exercise to simulate real-world GRC analysis.

## ✅ What I Learned  

🎯 Governance provides direction and accountability  
🎯 Risk management is about prioritisation and continuous evaluation  
🎯 Compliance requires evidence and structured documentation  
🎯 NIST 800 53 control families must be clearly understood for audit readiness  
🎯 Control categorisation matters in real-world assessment scenarios  
🎯 Mapping assets to permissions is foundational for IAM and least privilege  

This project strengthened my ability to interpret regulatory frameworks and apply them practically, something critical for IAM, SecOps, and GRC focused roles.
